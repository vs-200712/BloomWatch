# 🌸 BloomWatch – NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2025

## 🚀 Project Overview
BloomWatch is a data-driven solution to monitor plant blooming patterns and harmful algal blooms.  
The goal is to support **farmers, fishermen, and environmental researchers** by predicting bloom cycles and providing early warnings.  

This project is submitted as part of the **NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2025**.

## 📊 Features
- Tracks bloom days of different plants.
- CSV dataset integration for plant bloom durations.
- Visualizations (Bar Charts & Pie Charts) for bloom analysis.
- Future scope: integration with satellite data and mobile app for real-time updates.
